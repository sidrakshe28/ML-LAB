We might decide that two texts are plagiarized if a large percentage of words in both passages are the same or if a set of words occur in the same order.\n","\n","This is exactly how we will tackle the plagiarism problem; by computing the similarity of two text documents using what is called Containment and Longest Common Subsequence.\n","\n","\n","How Code Similarity Checker work?\n","\n","Using a sophisticated code plagiarism tool, Codeleaks can check similarity between two codes by comparing the original file with other available files by submitting them for automated examination and reviewing the results. Its highly advanced similarity check software helps the software to catch plagiarism.\n","\n","\n","This code plagiarism checker is easy to use and very precise. Codeleaks is able to check different programming languages and see if there are traces of plagiarism. It is common that code that is available online is more likely to be infringed upon and used by people without proper usage rights. Simple input the code and see if has been used elsewhere.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","How do we analyze text?\n","\n","We all know that computers can only understand 0s and 1s, and for us to perform some computation on textual data we need a way to convert the text into numbers.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Word embedding\n","The process of converting the textual data into an array of numbers is generally known as word embedding.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","The vectorization of textual data to vectors is not a random process instead it follows certain algorithms resulting in words being represented as a position in space. we going to use scikit-learn built-in features to do this.\n","\n","\n","\n","How do we detect similarity in documents?\n","Here we gonna use the basic concept of vector, dot product to determine how closely two texts are similar by computing the value of cosine similarity between vectors representations of student’s text assignments.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Also, you need to have sample text documents on the student’s assignments which we gonna use in testing our model.\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5jWLfMGaoLiG"},"source":["#code-"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"SDLkJ3bOfK7H"},"source":["import os\n","from
